## Principles

1. Generated templates will be kept simple.
2. Generated templates are a starting point, not a completed application.
3. Generated templates must be able to compile and run once generated.
4. Templates should have comments to aid developers. This includes links to signup pages for keys, MSDN, blogs and how-to's.  All guidance provide should be validated from either the framework/SDK/libraryâ€™s creator.
5. Code should follow [.NET Core coding style](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md).
